# FloodGeoSpatialHelper
CodeFunDo++ Idea: To use geospatial data and other Azure services in mitigating flood damages.

We plan to make use of Machine Learning and AI concepts to provide safe evacuation routes to people in flood affected areas.

A few examples of the idea:

![Elevation image](/images/elevation.png) 

Primary Goal:

1. Construct an evacuation strategy. 
We propose to do this by using a search strategy like A* search with heuristics such as elevation and terrain.

Stretch Goals(Subject to change):

2. Rehabilitation Planning
3. Damage Assesment.
               
Technologies to be used: We hope to achieve this using Azure's Geospatial Analytics along Machine Learning APIs.
