# FloodGeoSpatialHelper
CodeFunDo++ Idea to use geospatial data and other Azure services in mitigating flood damages.


We hope to implement a bunch of ideas to mitigate flood damages as listed in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230660751_Remote_sensing_and_GIS_Applications_in_Flood_Management. However, we plan to make use of Machine Learning and AI concepts to do the same instead of using complex hydrological simulations as done in the paper.

Primary Goal: 1. Construct an evacuation strategy. Initial heuristic that we have come up with is elevation.

Stretch Goals(Subject to change): 2. Rehabilitation Planning
                                  3. Damage Assesment.
               
Technologies used: We hope to achieve this using Azure's Geospatial Data services in tandem with Azure's Machine Learning and Computer Vision APIs.
